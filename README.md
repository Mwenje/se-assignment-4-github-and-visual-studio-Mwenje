Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
Repositories on GitHub:
GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
Some of the primary functions of Github are:-
1. Version Control with Git which is centralized Git repository
2. Collaboration Tools that enhance colaboration eg Pull Requests
3. Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
4. Documentation
5. Easy File Management

some of Github Features are:-
1. Collaborative Coding-Contribute to projects quickly with automatic environment setup.
2. Automation & CI/CD-allows developers to automate workflows, such as running tests, building code, or deploying applications
3. Security-Automatically review every change to your codebase and identify vulnerabilities before they reach production.
4. GitHub Copilot- AI tool that assists in writing code by providing context-aware suggestions, which helps developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
5. Community-GitHub Discussions allows for threaded conversations within repositories, making it easier for communities to collaborate, ask questions, and share knowledge.

GitHub encourages collaboration by allowing you to track changes with the benefit of version control. Youâ€™ll always have access to your complete history. You can also work with unlimited collaborators on big and small projects and leave messages telling contributors what you did and why.
